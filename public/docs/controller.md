# Controller Guide

This section is for users with `Controller` access.

## Open a Board

1. Go to `/` and select an active airport.
2. Open the board for that airport.

## Manage Strips

On the board you can:
- Move strips between sectors by click or drag/drop.
- Edit strip details.
- Delete strips.
- Update squawk and notes.

## Bulk Actions

Use strip checkboxes for multi-select workflows:
- Export selected strips
- Delete selected strips
- Transfer selected strips

## Operational Flow

Typical progression:

`Delivery -> Ground -> Tower -> Departure -> Approach -> Control`

Use local event SOP as final authority for handoff timing.

## Coordination Views

- Use `/all-flights` for cross-airport oversight.
- Use FIDS pages for airport display context.

## Good Practices

- Keep notes concise and operational.
- Confirm callsign before delete/edit actions.
- Use transfer tools for handoffs instead of recreating strips.
