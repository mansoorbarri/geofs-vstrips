# Pilot Guide

This section is for all signed-in users.

## File a Flight Plan

1. Open `/file-flight`.
2. Fill in your callsign, GeoFS callsign, aircraft, route, and performance fields.
3. Submit the form.

Notes:
- If event filing is closed, you will see **No Active Event**.
- Some fields may be locked by event admins.

## Edit Your Flight Plan

1. Open `/edit-flight`.
2. Select a flight in **DELIVERY** status.
3. Update details and save.

Important:
- Only flights in `DELIVERY` can be edited.
- Flights in other statuses are read-only for pilots.

## Delete Your Flight Plan

Pilot self-delete depends on current event workflow:
- If your event staff allows pilot deletion, use the delete action where provided.
- If you do not see a delete option, contact a controller/admin to remove your strip.

## Common Issues

- **I cannot file a flight**: Event may be offline or fields are invalid.
- **My flight is missing in edit page**: Make sure you are signed in with the same account used to file.
- **I cannot edit my flight**: It is likely no longer in `DELIVERY` status.
